1. Q: What is the main premise of the Gate Control Theory of pain?
   A. Pain signals are only processed in the brain
   B. Pain signals can be blocked at the spinal cord level by non-painful input
   C. Massage removes pain signals from nerves
   D. Pain only results from injury to bones
   Correct Answer: Pain signals can be blocked at the spinal cord level by non-painful input

2. Q: Where in the nervous system does the 'gate' in Gate Control Theory exist?
   A. Cerebral cortex
   B. Brainstem
   C. Dorsal horn of the spinal cord
   D. Peripheral nerves
   Correct Answer: Dorsal horn of the spinal cord

3. Q: Which type of nerve fibers are responsible for closing the pain gate?
   A. C fibers
   B. A-delta fibers
   C. A-beta fibers
   D. Sympathetic fibers
   Correct Answer: A-beta fibers

4. Q: What role does massage play in the Gate Control Theory?
   A. It activates pain fibers directly
   B. It stimulates fast-conducting A-beta fibers to inhibit pain
   C. It bypasses spinal nerves
   D. It increases pain sensitivity
   Correct Answer: It stimulates fast-conducting A-beta fibers to inhibit pain

5. Q: Which of the following sensations can help 'close the gate' on pain?
   A. Light touch and vibration
   B. Sharp stabbing pain
   C. Pressure from a deep wound
   D. Sudden trauma
   Correct Answer: Light touch and vibration

6. Q: Why is Gate Control Theory important in massage therapy?
   A. It explains how massage decreases lymph flow
   B. It shows how certain strokes may worsen inflammation
   C. It provides a neurological basis for massage's pain-relieving effects
   D. It proves massage can realign spinal vertebrae
   Correct Answer: It provides a neurological basis for massage's pain-relieving effects

7. Q: How does deep pressure affect the gate control mechanism?
   A. It closes the gate faster than light pressure
   B. It may stimulate pain fibers and open the gate
   C. It deactivates nerve pathways
   D. It has no effect on the gate
   Correct Answer: It may stimulate pain fibers and open the gate

8. Q: Which technique best aligns with Gate Control Theory to reduce pain?
   A. Effleurage and vibration
   B. Tapotement and friction
   C. Trigger point therapy
   D. Myofascial release
   Correct Answer: Effleurage and vibration

9. Q: What happens when the pain gate is 'open'?
   A. Pain perception decreases
   B. Non-painful signals are enhanced
   C. Pain signals reach the brain more easily
   D. The spinal cord stops processing input
   Correct Answer: Pain signals reach the brain more easily

10. Q: Which best describes the relationship between sensory input and pain modulation in Gate Control Theory?
   A. Sensory input has no effect on pain
   B. Stimulating sensory receptors can inhibit pain perception
   C. Sensory input always increases pain signals
   D. Pain only occurs with sensory loss
   Correct Answer: Stimulating sensory receptors can inhibit pain perception
