1. Q: What is negative feedback in the body?
   A. A process that amplifies a change
   B. A process that reverses a deviation from the set point
   C. A hormonal imbalance
   D. A failure of the nervous system
   Correct Answer: A process that reverses a deviation from the set point

2. Q: Which of the following is an example of negative feedback?
   A. Blood clotting after injury
   B. Childbirth contractions
   C. Sweating to reduce body temperature
   D. Lactation during breastfeeding
   Correct Answer: Sweating to reduce body temperature

3. Q: What is the role of positive feedback in physiology?
   A. To maintain homeostasis by correcting deviations
   B. To reduce internal body heat
   C. To intensify or reinforce a stimulus
   D. To control skeletal muscle tone
   Correct Answer: To intensify or reinforce a stimulus

4. Q: Which of the following is an example of positive feedback?
   A. Regulating blood sugar with insulin
   B. Slowing heart rate when calm
   C. Uterine contractions during childbirth
   D. Decreasing blood pressure after exercise
   Correct Answer: Uterine contractions during childbirth

5. Q: Why is negative feedback more common than positive feedback in the body?
   A. It is easier to activate
   B. It amplifies biological changes
   C. It promotes long-term stability and homeostasis
   D. It uses fewer hormones
   Correct Answer: It promotes long-term stability and homeostasis

6. Q: What does a feedback loop require to function properly?
   A. A nerve impulse
   B. A control center, receptor, and effector
   C. A muscle contraction
   D. A blood vessel
   Correct Answer: A control center, receptor, and effector

7. Q: Which feedback mechanism involves the hypothalamus and helps regulate body temperature?
   A. Positive feedback
   B. Feed-forward mechanism
   C. Negative feedback
   D. Hormonal cascade
   Correct Answer: Negative feedback

8. Q: What happens in a positive feedback loop?
   A. The response weakens the original stimulus
   B. The body returns to its normal state
   C. The response strengthens the original stimulus
   D. No change occurs
   Correct Answer: The response strengthens the original stimulus

9. Q: How does the body regulate blood sugar through negative feedback?
   A. By increasing blood sugar levels after meals
   B. By using glucagon only
   C. By releasing insulin to lower elevated glucose
   D. By raising insulin when blood sugar is low
   Correct Answer: By releasing insulin to lower elevated glucose

10. Q: Which of the following is NOT an example of negative feedback?
   A. Shivering when cold
   B. Increased blood clotting after injury
   C. Regulating blood pressure
   D. Balancing pH levels
   Correct Answer: Increased blood clotting after injury
